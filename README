                         Yahoozy — Curses Yatzy
                       ──────────────────────────

Yahoozy is a curses-based TUI implementation of the popular dice game
Yatzy.  Yatzy is very similar to the more internationally-known game
‘Yahtzee’ and is more well known in the Nordic countries.

Yahoozy is feature complete and there are no plans to update this
repository.  This was merely a learning exercise for building interactive
TUIs via immediate-mode UIs.

The game comes with no instruction manual so you should consult the
helpful Wikipedia page[1], but it does come with many mnemonic keyboard
shortcuts that are documented at the bottom of each screen.

Highscores are stored persistently on a per-user basis and can be found
at the following locations depending on your operating system:

    Windows    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Yahoozy\history
    MacOS      ~/Library/Application Support/Yahoozy/history
    POSIX      $XDG_DATA_HOME/yahoozy/history (or)
               ~/.local/share/yahoozy/history

Note that while Windows support was attempted, I don’t own a Windows
computer and as such cannot verify that it works bug-free.
